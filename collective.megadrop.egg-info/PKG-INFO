              RichText dropdown.
            * Added base control panel for future development.
            
        To Do
        
            * Create method to mark folderish content with IRichTextMegaDrop.
            * Create tabbed interface to edit custom RichText fields in control panel.
        
        1.0dev4
        
        Updates
        
            * Trimmed up viewlets.py and added further notation
            * Four column layout preserved when column math results in remainder
        
        1.0dev3
        
        Updates
        
            * Fixed column slicing to include all results
        
        Known Issues
        
            * Template needs conditional to prevent drop down of non-folderish tab types.
            * CSS needs tweaking for sub-page display highlighting.
        
        1.0dev2
        
        Updates
        
            * jquery.megadrop.js correctly toggles dropdown.  When javascript is disabled global navigation
                tabs take you to landing page for each tab.
            * Pulls viewable types from navigation preferences
            * Megadrop dropdown menu is divided into 4 columns.
        
        Known Issues
        
            * Some items not listing when greater than 5 items in container.
        
        1.0dev1
        
        Known Issues
        
            * Currently jquery.megadrop.js only toggles the megahide class on and off.  It should allow
                navigation with mouse and keyboard of revealed list structure.
            * megadrop.css is minimal, displaying subtree <ul> structure in block format.
            * After displaying hidden divs, the <h2>'s in tab structure lose inline styling.
